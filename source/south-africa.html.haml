      %h4 Take a giant leap in t0 the software development industry

        The concept of Craft Academy Bootcamp is simple, it is a 12-weeks intensive coding camp, aimed at teaching you the fundamentals
        of web development, enabling you to hit the ground running – and keep running.
        But what is important is that modern engineering practices are considered to be part of this foundation.
        As a student, you work from day one with automated testing, continuous integration and deployment,
        and other essential skills. Meaning that when you enter the workforce and are faced with a problem,
        your instinct will be to solve right rather than just hacking a solution together.
      %p.copy--left
        During 12 weeks immersive, instructor-led, remote camp, we prepare students with little/no experience in programming for a career in tech and teach them the fundamentals of web development. We teach all the latest technologies, like Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, SQL, Ajax but also skills like Object Oriented Design, Test Driven Development, Agile Methodology and version control with Git.
