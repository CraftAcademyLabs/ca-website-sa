          You do not need prior coding experience. You do not need to be a computer wiz or have studied computer science. You need to be hungry. We can teach anyone to code, if they are focused and committed.

        We believe that traditional education teaches students to do well on tests, rather than give them actual knowledge and experience.
        At Craft Academy, we provide neither grades nor diplomas. Instead, we help you develop the tools you need to be successful.
        Our course is unique, not just in intensity, but in approach. We provide a structured daily learning plan, projects, assignments and challenges, and continually push your limits to achieve the fastest learning possible. All in twelve weeks.
